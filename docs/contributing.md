### Dev Tools

Make sure you've got the latest `yarn` (1.7.0) and the latest `node` (8.6.0).  There are some
issues with older combos of these.  =)

Also if you encounter a problem with `electron 1.8.6` passing checksums, there was a bug in
earlier versions of node with their checksum process.  Clear your Yarn cache `yarn cache clean` to
grab the latests copies.

The project expects TypeScript and TSLint to be installed globally.
Follow the installation instructions for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) and [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).
Usually, this looks like:

```
yarn global add tslint typescript
```
